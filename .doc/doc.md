### How to Update Calendar Events
* Log into Google Calendar with MAS Google account
* A calendar category called "MAS Website" has been created (<span style="background-color: #FFFF00">Do not modify any settings for this calendar category</span>). Any edits to the calendar will be **immediately** deployed to the production website -- so be careful what you change!
