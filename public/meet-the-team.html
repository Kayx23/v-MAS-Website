                        working at Manulife and Swiss RE and would be happy to answer any questions you might have about work as an actuarial co-op, balancing extra-curricular
                        commitments or studying for actuarial exams. Outside of school, I enjoy watching Hockey, UFC and going to the gym.</p>
